# Multi-Lingual Sentiment Analysis of Urdu and English Tweets Using RNN with Bidirectional LSTM

## Project Overview

This project introduces a cross-lingual sentiment analysis model designed to evaluate sentiments expressed in tweets associated with Pakistan’s political parties, across three languages: Urdu, transliterated Urdu, and English.

## Prerequisites

Before running the project, ensure you have the following installed:

- Python 3.8+
- Jupyter Notebook
- NumPy
- BERT
- mBERT
- RoBERTa
- TensorFlow/PyTorch
- scikit-learn
- Matplotlib

## Summary

The focus of our study was multilingual sentiment analysis,
a crucial aspect of natural language processing. We deployed
various models to examine language-specific behaviors, such
as RNN with Bi-LSTM, mBERT, RoBERTa, Random Forest,
and Logistic Regression. Our RNN model with Bi-LSTM
stood out, surpassing the other models in accuracy and loss.
Moreover, the model’s proficiency in identifying delayed dependencies
and utilizing a two-way algorithm to detect subtleties
in multilingual data were key factors in its success. Our
results support the viability of our proposed method
for multilingual sensitivity analysis. Our findings demonstrate
the feasibility of our proposed multilingual sensitivity analysis
approach. Our study is a step forward in the research regarding
fields such as low-resource language analysis, e-commerce,
social media, and market research sectors to improve their goods
and services and target different customer categories with their
marketing campaigns.
